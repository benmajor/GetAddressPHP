# GetAddress.io PHP SDK

This is a PHP SDK wrapper for the excellent GetAddress.io API for performing UK postcode lookups at incredibly realistic and affordable prices for developers and store owners. Official SDKs are available for .NET and jQuery, and while there are several written in PHP available, most seem to be incomplete when compared to the current API documentation available on the getAddress() website.

Please note, this library is not maintained by GetAddress.io or its staff. All efforts by the plugin author have been made to ensure that the SDK is up-to-date with the current API release as outline in the [online documentation](https://getaddress.io/Documentation).

### Installation:

The easiest and most convenient way to install the SDK is to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) as follows:

```bash
$ composer install benmajor/getaddress-php
```
